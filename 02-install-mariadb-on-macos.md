==> Caveats
A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
server starting up correctly.

MySQL is configured to only allow connections from localhost by default

To start mariadb now and restart at login:
  brew services start mariadb
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/mariadb/bin/mariadbd-safe --datadir\=/opt/homebrew/var/mysql
